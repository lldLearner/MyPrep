🎃 Haunted House Problem — Interview Explanation
Problem Statement (in your own words)

We have N people.
Each person i has a constraint:

They will go only if at least L[i] other people also go.

They refuse to go if more than H[i] other people go.

So if total group size = K:

Each person i is fine if:

L[i] ≤ (K - 1) ≤ H[i]


We want the maximum K possible such that K people are happy with K.

🧠 Correct Insight

For a given K, a person joins if:

L[i] + 1 ≤ K ≤ H[i] + 1


Because L and H are "other people", but K includes the person itself.

So each person supports all K in this interval.
This is like each person voting for a range of valid K.

We want:

#people supporting K   ≥ K

⭐ Your 4 Solutions Explained (Interview Style)
1️⃣ Brute Force — O(2^N) — Show interviewer you understand the search space

“A naive solution is to try all subsets of N people, check if each subset size K satisfies L ≤ K-1 ≤ H for all members.

That’s 2^N subsets → exponential → not feasible.”

2️⃣ O(N²) – Range counting with a frequency array
Idea:

For each person:

They support all values K in [L+1, H+1]


Maintain:

count[K] = how many people support group size K


Then:

Find max K such that count[K] ≥ K


Pretty direct.

Code snippet (your solutionTwo):
for each person:
    for (k = L+1; k <= H+1; k++) count[k]++

🧪 Dry-run for the Example

Input:

6 people
[1,2]
[1,4]
[0,3]
[0,1]
[3,4]
[0,2]


Let’s compute each person’s supported K range (K = number of total people):

Person	L	H	Supports K from →
P0	1	2	2 to 3
P1	1	4	2 to 5
P2	0	3	1 to 4
P3	0	1	1 to 2
P4	3	4	4 to 5
P5	0	2	1 to 3

Let’s fill count array:

K=1: P2, P3, P5 → 3
K=2: P0, P1, P2, P3, P5 → 5
K=3: P0, P1, P2, P5 → 4
K=4: P1, P2, P4 → 3
K=5: P1, P4 → 2


Now check:

K=1 → 3 ≥ 1 ✔
K=2 → 5 ≥ 2 ✔
K=3 → 4 ≥ 3 ✔
K=4 → 3 < 4 ✖
K=5 → 2 < 5 ✖


Maximum valid K = 3
